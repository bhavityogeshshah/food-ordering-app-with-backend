# Food Ordering Application

In this project I have learned about how to use different react hooks like the useContext, useReducer and many more. Along with the I also learned how to display a modal on the UI.
The data used in this project is kept in the backend folder, it is some dumy data that is being used to render on the UI.


## How to run
Go to the backend folder and run to start the dummy backend services created 

```
npm start
```

then comeback to the starting folder and run to start the frontend services

```
npm run dev
```
